# NetCore.CSOM
An .NET Core port of the SharePoint CSOM library (version "16.1.6216.1200") for SharePoint Online.

I wanted to do a POC of the CSOM library ported to .NET Core... and here it is.

To get this going:
- just update the credentials in program.cs and run the console application

Currently, I'm about at 40% feature parity with the .NET 4.5 CSOM library
